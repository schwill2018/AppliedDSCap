-Let's say you are moving cities due to work. You might enjoy the sights and thrills of living in a new city, but it can be like an alien world if one isn't quite traveled!
-So you want to move to a neighborhood in one of your relocation cities that resembles the neighborhoods you are used to.
-Essentially, you want to try to quantize the feeling of "home".
  -You may want to achieve a location-based lifestyle that is very similar to your current home city. 
  -You may want to be exposed to living in a new area; or perhaps you want to use this opportunity to search for your dream neighborhood, packed with all of the ideal sights, stores, and venues that come with it.
-My project aims to build a recommendation that is diverse and dynamic enough to handle all the possibilities listed above.
